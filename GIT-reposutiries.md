## Free GIT Repository!

Every project that I work on,  we will set-up a free GIT repository so you will have access to your source code 24/7.  Thats right you can watch every step of the way as we work  on your project.  We don’t know of any  other firm that would do that!

## Free GIT Repository

* Your code is hosted on secure and reliable Amazon hosting servers with failover backups
* Activity stream shows commit logs for your project
* Commit Alerts – receive a notification any time a commit is made to your project real-time, hourly, or daily. Commit Alerts available via Email, RSS, and Twitter!
* Simple Web-based team and access management
* Easily browse code and changesets using our beautiful code browser with syntax-highlighting for most languages
* Keep your intellectual property safe with private permissioning
* Build and copy code templates: Now you can have amazing copy-and-go productivity. Configure a template space, or find one in our catalog, and select the “copy” link on your template space. You will get a complete copy of the repository to work on.
* Encrypted access with HTTPS.
* Optional daily backups to your own Amazon S3 account.
* See your web pages as soon as you commit them to the repository with the View as Web Page feature.
