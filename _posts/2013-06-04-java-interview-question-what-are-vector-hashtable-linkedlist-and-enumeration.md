### Vector

The Vector class provides the capability to implement a growable array of objects.

### Hashtabl

The Hashtable class implements a Hashtable data structure. A Hashtable indexes and stores objects in a dictionary using hash codes as the objectâ€™s keys.
Hash codes are integer values that identify objects.

### LinkedList

Removing or inserting elements in the middle of an array can be done using LinkedList. A LinkedList stores each object in a separate link whereas an array stores object references in consecutive locations.

### Enumeration

An object that implements the Enumeration interface generates a series of elements, one at a time. It has two methods, namely hasMoreElements() and nextElement().

HasMoreElemnts() tests if this enumeration has more elements and nextElement method returns successive elements of the series.
