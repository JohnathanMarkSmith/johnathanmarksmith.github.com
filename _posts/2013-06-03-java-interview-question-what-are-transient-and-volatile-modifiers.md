So What are Transient and Volatile Modifiers???????

The Transient modifier applies to variables only and it is not stored as part of its objectâ€™s Persistent state. Transient variables are not serialized.

The Volatile modifier applies to variables only and it tells the compiler that the variable modified by volatile can be changed unexpectedly by other parts of the program.
