Sometimes working on development projects you will need to see who authored a change in a file.

It could be that you have to track down who entered a bug into the system or you just need to know "Who Authored This Code?"

Git once again will make your life easy... All you have to do it enter the following command!


{% highlight bash %}
git blame <filename>
{% endhighlight %}
