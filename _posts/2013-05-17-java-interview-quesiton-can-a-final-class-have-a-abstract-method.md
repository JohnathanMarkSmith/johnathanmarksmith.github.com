No. I final class can not have a abstract method in it because when you declare a method in a class as abstract, then the class must be declared as abstract.

"Final" and "Abstract" cannot used at the same time. Any class can be either final or abstract not both!

   Final class means cannot be subclassed.
   Abstract class means must be subclassed.
