Interface is similar to a class which may contain method’s signature only but not bodies and it is a formal set of method and constant declarations that must be defined by the class that implements it.

Interfaces are useful for:

    a)Declaring methods that one or more classes are expected to implement

    b)Capturing similarities between unrelated classes without forcing a class relationship.

    c)Determining an object’s programming interface without revealing the actual body of the class.
