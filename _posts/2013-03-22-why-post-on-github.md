Let think about this, Why not use a public system like GitHub to post resumes and other documents that you would like to track or make public to others. GitHub can be used for so much more then just source code tracking. Think about it… any document you would like to track or share you can just GitHub and it does not have to be documents. You can keep workstation settings, scripts or anything in it. We need to stop thinking of GitHub if a web0bases hosting service for software development projects. You can make public and private repositories and put anything into them..

I have over 24 years experience specializing in business technology in the areas of web application development and collaborative computing. I love working as an architect-developer for applications or product development. I am particularly interested in organizations that use leading technologies such as Git, Springs, WebFlow, Maven, JUnit, JSP’s, Servlets, XML, Java, Struts, PHP, LDAP, Android and Web Application Servers. I have a very solid background with Java, OOP, Design-Patterns and Multi-Threading.

I am also able to interface with all levels of management and by posting my resume on GitHub.com at github.com/JohnathanSmith/resume in a number of formats I open the door to a number of organizations and recruiters looking for Java, Springs Consultants. I can now tell the organization or the recruiter to goto github.com/JohnathanSmith/resume and download my resume in the format the organization or recruiter is looking for.
