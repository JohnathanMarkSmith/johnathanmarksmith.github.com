I don't know what it is but I see it day in and day out. Someone reads a number of websites and learns some buzz words and everyone thinks wow he is so smart he is the best programmer we have.

Learning all the buzz words and and speaking will is a key thing in the world today but I really feel that the fims have to start to look at the programmers then can develop good code and get good products out. Talking good is not going to get the job done. 

Think about it... Do you want someone that can really get your projects done on time and the right way or someone that can talk about it day in and day out.

Hmm..
