I had to install Java Open JDK 1.7 and SDK on a number of linux boxs last night.  

I had some coworkers asking the same question time and time again "How Do I Install Java Open JDK 1.7?". 

So to make it easy once again here is my post and the details on how to do it.

{% highlight bash %}

su -c "yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk*"

{% endhighlight %}

Thats all you have to do... stop asking... :)

Here is the video
