## Alternative Marketing

## There are three things that matter in property: location, location,location.

This phrase’s first documented use was in June, 1956. For generations, we have used this mantra when selecting the best spot to set up our business. We made our choice based upon foot traffic, proximity to major roads and visibility to potential clients. Our marketing campaigns were built around our physical address.

## Same song, different dance.

In today’s world, it’s still “location, location, location”. The difference is, Google is our new landlord, and our rent is the amount we pay for premier placement. We used to be concerned with the window dressing of our store front, today your home page is your store front. Just like your physical office is a direct reflection of you, so too is your website.

## What is Alternative Marketing?

Simply put, Alternative Marketing is the process required to get your business noticed. Previously, you may have used traditional advertising (newspaper, direct mail, radio and tv spots, or telemarketing). In the Alternative world, we use Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Video Search Engine Optimization (VSEO), Social Media Optimization (SMO) and Reputation Management.

## Why Alternative Marketing?

Simply having a website is not enough. If your current and prospective clients can’t find you on the web, what is the point of having a site?

Think about what you do on a daily basis. If you know a company’s name, do you try to guess their web address or do you use Google?  If you need the phone number of a business, do you go find your most recent copy of the yellow pages, or do you use a search engine? When searching for a product or service on the web, do you click on the search results at the bottom of the page or the results at the top?

## Can your clients find you?  We can help.
