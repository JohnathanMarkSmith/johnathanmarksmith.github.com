## Java Interview Questions

After over 25 years I still don't like going on interview and getting asked questions that a good programmer/developer dont have to know off the top of his/her head. I good programmer/developer should NOT know all the anwsers but should know how to find them and where to search.  

I am posting this page so programmers/developers can bookmark it and use it.  I am going to be posting some questions that I think everyone will ask.  If you have any questions that I am missing please email me.
